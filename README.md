# INVERSE-OF-A-MATRIX
## Aim:
To write a python program to find the inverse of a matrix
## Equipment’s required:
1. 	Hardware – PCs
2. 	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner
##Algorithm:

Step1 : import numpy as np
Step 2: An array is initialized using numpy and stored in variable x.
Step 3: The array is inversed using the function numpy. linalg. inv(x)
Step 4:Inversed array is stored in variable y.
Step 5:Now we'll print both array x and y.
Step 6: End the program

## Program:
#Program to find the inverse of a matrix.
#Developed by:S.Meena
#RegisterNumber:21500895
```
import numpy as np
A=np.array([[6,2,3],[3,1,1],[10,3,4]])
s=np.linalg.inv(A)
print(s)
```
## Output:
![OUTPUT](./ss..png)

## Result:
Thus the inverse of given matrix is successfully solved using python program
